# client-api-kit

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#14](https://github.com/org-utils/client-api-kit/pull/14) [`f1b3050`](https://github.com/org-utils/client-api-kit/commit/f1b3050d2175a9e9f1e6e2a631105b96bc2ddec9) Thanks [@Anwarkamal143](https://github.com/Anwarkamal143)! - - New `mode` option on `createResource` selects how outcomes are reported. The default stays `"throw"` (methods reject with `ApiClientError` - required by the hooks layer). The old `onError` option is kept as a deprecated alias for `mode` (when both are given, `mode` wins).
  - `mode: "result"` - every method resolves a typed `ResourceResult<T>` union (`{ success: true; data }` or `{ success: false; error: ApiClientError }`) instead of throwing, convenient for server components and server actions.
  - `mode: "query"` - every method resolves a settled `QueryResult<T>` with the same field names the hooks return (`data`, `error`, `status`, `isError`, `isSuccess`, `isLoading`, `isPending`, `isFetching`). It is type-safe where `UseQueryResult` is loose: `status` is a strict discriminant and the boolean flags are literal types, so `data` narrows to `T` exactly when `isSuccess` and `error` to `ApiClientError` exactly when `isError`. `isLoading`/`isPending`/`isFetching` are always `false` after `await` (the call is settled), kept for shape parity so a component can swap a hook call for a plain resource call.
  - New `setMode(mode)` method (like `setHeaders`/`setConfig`) switches the resource's mode at runtime and returns the same resource typed for the new mode; the switch is global to the resource.
  - `createResourcePrefetcher` is now mode-agnostic: it accepts a resource in any mode and extracts the payload (or throws the `ApiClientError`) from its result shape via the new exported `unwrapResourceResult` helper. The hooks layer (`createResourceHooks`) still expects the default `"throw"` mode so rejected promises set `isError`.
  
  Also added optional `parse` validators to `createResource` options - one per method (`list`, `getById`, `create`, `update`), applied to `response.data` at runtime before it's returned (works with zod schemas). A failing validator is normalized into an `ApiClientError` with `kind: "unknown"` and the original error as its cause. `custom()` accepts a per-call `parse` for its payload.

The `onError` option is kept as a deprecated alias for `mode`.
  
  - `mode: "query"` (new default) - every method resolves a settled `QueryResult<T>` with the same field names the hooks return (`data`, `error`, `status`, `isError`, `isSuccess`, `isLoading`, `isPending`, `isFetching`). It is type-safe where `UseQueryResult` is loose: `status` is a strict discriminant and the boolean flags are literal types, so `data` narrows to `T` exactly when `isSuccess` and `error` to `ApiClientError` exactly when `isError`. `isLoading`/`isPending`/`isFetching` are always `false` after `await` (the call is settled), kept for shape parity so a component can swap a hook call for a plain resource call.
  - `mode: "result"` - every method resolves a typed `ResourceResult<T>` union (`{ success: true; data }` or `{ success: false; error: ApiClientError }`) instead of throwing.
  - New `setMode(mode)` method (like `setHeaders`/`setConfig`) switches the resource's mode at runtime and returns the same resource typed for the new mode; the switch is global to the resource.
  - `createResourceHooks` and `createResourcePrefetcher` are now mode-agnostic: they accept a resource in any mode and extract the payload (or throw the `ApiClientError`) from its result shape via the new exported `unwrapResourceResult` helper.

  - `mode: "result"` - every method resolves a typed `ResourceResult<T>` union (`{ success: true; data }` or `{ success: false; error: ApiClientError }`) instead of throwing, convenient for server components and server actions.
  - `mode: "query"` - every method resolves a settled, TanStack Query-shaped `QueryResult<T>` with the same field names the hooks return (`data`, `error`, `status`, `isError`, `isSuccess`, `isLoading`, `isPending`, `isFetching`). It is type-safe where `UseQueryResult` is loose: `status` is a strict discriminant and the boolean flags are literal types, so `data` narrows to `T` exactly when `isSuccess` and `error` to `ApiClientError` exactly when `isError`. `isLoading`/`isPending`/`isFetching` are always `false` after `await` (the call is settled), kept for shape parity so a component can swap a hook call for a plain resource call.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#12](https://github.com/org-utils/client-api-kit/pull/12) [`9dae16a`](https://github.com/org-utils/client-api-kit/commit/9dae16a53d68a5526edac267e02d716c78a956d9) Thanks [@Anwarkamal143](https://github.com/Anwarkamal143)! - Added TanStack Query prefetch support via a new `client-api-kit/server` entry point (`createResourcePrefetcher`). Prefetch functions (`prefetchList`, `prefetchInfiniteList`, `prefetchGetById`, `prefetchCustom`) share the hooks' query keys, so they work server-side with `dehydrate`/`HydrationBoundary` (SSR hydration) and client-side before navigation. `createQueryClient` is now also exported from `client-api-kit/server`.
  
  Also reordered `createResource`'s generic type parameters to `<T, ListParams, CreateInput, UpdateInput>` and added a `custom` query-key builder to `createQueryKeys`.
